The controls for both games use WASD keys to move and support controllers.
Hitting the escape key on keyboard or the start button (the hamburger menu) for controller will close the game.


Inside the GP2Team7_HWG_Prototype_GP folder is the build files for the mechanics prototype.  In here will be
a working guard AI, player movement, and camera script.  It is zipped to be uploaded for GitHub.

Inside the GP2Team7_HWG_Prototype_ART folder is the build files for the art models prototype.
In here will be the models for most of the scene's kitchen layout, including:

♦ Animated cats Mozzi and Cheddar
♦ Pepper Jack the mouse (the player character)
♦ A table (the hallway)
♦ Cheese (the win condition)
♦ A chair (to connect the hallway with the win condition room)
♦ A broom (to connect the starting room with the hallway)
♦ Some cat toys to act as obstacles in the first area
♦ Some table pieces for obstacles in the hallway
♦ And the kitchen counter to act as the final area

We will have elements of verticality in our game, so there are connections between the hallway and the adjacent areas.
They are not areas of their own, just a quick ramp to make sense visually for our theme.
